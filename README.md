# AllChat Messaging App

This repo serves as the foundation for an even greater messenger app in the foreseeable future.

Current Version: AllChat V1

## Motivation

We intend to build a chatroom app that is able to automatically translate messages into different languages upon sending. AllChat V1 currently supports a basic chatroom with multiple users in English.

## Build Status

Currently able to create a user and sustain a single chat room shared by multiple users. Sign-in authentication, multiple chat rooms, and dynamic translation of messages are still in progress.

## Features

Currently, nothing sets this app apart from other messenger services. It is merely serving as a step/groundwork for what it will become in our next project.

## How To Use?

On the landing page, click "Get Started" and enter a username into the modal, then click "Join Chat Room". Once on the chat page, you can message other users who are currently signed in. If you wish to exit the chat, and sign up using a different name, click the "Leave" button in the top-right corner, and repeat the aforementioned steps.

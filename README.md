# AllChat Messaging App

Much like other messaging apps, AllChat connects people from all around the world and all walks of life. However, unlike other messenger services, AllChat allows its users to connect and communicate, even if they do not speak the same language.

## Motivation

As communication continues to increase on a global scale, so too does the demand for quick, reliable translation.

## Features

There are many different messaging apps out there. You got the default messenger on your typical smartphone; that will let you communicate across the country. Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp allow you to connect with people outside your country, but what if you wanted to talk to someone in France, but couldn't speak a lick of French? 

That's where AllChat comes in. 

AllChat utilizes its built-in API to automatically translate the sender's message into the recipient's native language, allowing for more intuitive international communication. Whether its for sealing that important business deal, or discovering that special someone from across the globe, AllChat brings us all closer together.
